Postman examples for various QTS tasks

To use, import collections and environments into Postman.  Set a username and password on the collection for the NSX server you intend to manage, this will remove the need to set a username/password in every request.  Set a value for the 'nsx' and 'edge' variables in the 'HPC' environment, these are referenced for most of the requests made.  All other variales should be set by running the requests.
